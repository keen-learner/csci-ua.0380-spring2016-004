# CSCI-UA.0380 Final Project 

## Due Saturday, May 7th

You can create __anything__ you want for your final project, as long as it meets the technical requirements below!

### Milestones

* <code>4/13</code> - [proposals / meetings due (just fill out this linked form!)](https://docs.google.com/a/nyu.edu/forms/d/1g_CCYErNUJFT09RPcS2WkEY4hQVo-LswytQ5MULfxOc/viewform)
* <code>4/25</code> - first milestone 
    * have 2 of your 3 classes / decorators partially implemented
    * start on one of research modules
    * none of the code has to be running (I just want to see some code written!)
    * submit as a zip file of your project's directory
* <code>5/2</code> - second milestone
    * have your 3rd class or decorator implemented
    * have code for all of your research modules
    * submit as a zip file of your project's directory
    * have a version that _runs_ ... that is, that starts up without any syntax errors
    * include a text file called README.txt in your project that explains how to run it
* <code>5/7 </code> - completed project


## Requirements

#### <code>3 x </code> any of the following: 

* __classes__ (writing your own, not just using an existing one)
* __decorators__ (writing your own, not just using an existing one)
* ...or other __higher order functions__

#### <code>2 x </code> any of the following: 

* __list comprehensions__
* __map/filter__ 
* (not yet) __iterator__ or __generator__ (can be combined with class requirement)
* (research) __dictionary comprehension__

#### <code>3 x </code> total points worth of any of the following modules:

* <code>1 point</code>
    * turtle
    * matplotlib
    * pil
    * beautifulsoup
    * csv
    * requests
* <code>2 points</code>
    * flask
    * socket
    * (not yet) scikit learn
    * (research) nltk - natural language processing
    * (research) numpy - numerical computing
    * (research) opencv - computer vision
    * (research) pygame - game library
    * (research) tkinter, kiv, etc. - graphical user interface
* <code>? points</code>
    * suggest a module; we'll discuss how many points it should be worth
    * built-in modules like math or random won't count!

### Ideas

You're free to do whatever project you want, as long as it meets the technical requirements. You will not be graded on visual design, user experience or novelty. However, your project should be something that's _interesting_ for you to work on, and usually that means putting in some creative effort!

* an interactive story / web application
    * store high scores in a database or csv file
    * using flask to serve everything up
* data visualization
    * download data using requests
    * use csv module or beautiful soup to extract data
    * visualize data using turtle 
* creating a flask-like web framework
    * like we did in class / for hw
* instagram style site
    * using pil (the filters that you created form hw)
    * using requests to download an image from another iste
    * using flask to serve everything up
* use pygame to create a "platform" game
* digital instrument
    * digital signal processing
    * turtle or tkinter to create interface


### Working in Pairs

This is allowed, but with a lot of administrative work:

* set up some time to meet with me
* (mostly) double the requirements
* you may be required to use git and github to show who worked on what
* there may be additional meetings when milestones are due
